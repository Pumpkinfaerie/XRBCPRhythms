		Welcome! We're a local drumming group, open to everyone.<br/><br/>

We play at actions and events in support of Extinction Rebellion, and some non-XR events as requested, voted on by the band.<br/><br/>

If you'd like to request our support at an action or event, please use out support request form:

<h2>Interested in joining us?</h2>

<p>
We practice weekly and play samba-inspired music.<br/><br/>

We learn the national XR drumming songs, signs, and breaks so we can join forces at larger actions and play together in large numbers.<br/><br/>

Our main purpose is to support protests - usually climate-related, but we also support adjacent causes such as the marches for Palestine and Pride, and protests against injustices such as banks funding arms manufacturing, southern water's sewage dumping, excessive energy bills, corporate greed, and more. Our other main purpose is to create a community of like-minded people and have fun playing music every week in our practice sessions - there's never pressure to actually go to any particular protests!<br/><br/>
</p>

<p>
No musical talent is necessary, you don't need your own instrument (we have spares), and we often go through things from scratch because we regularly have new people join.<br/><br/>

If you've never been to protests or done anything political before, and if you're generally on the side of progressive, empathetic causes, joining the band can be a safer and more accessible way to actually get out on the streets and do something, without needing to make placards, shout slogans, or stand in front of traffic!<br/><br/>

Our main web site has more information about how to join, our practice times, dates and locations, and how to get in touch, as well as links to all our social media, videos, and telegram chats.<br/><br/>

Hope to see you at a practice or action soon!<br/><br/>
