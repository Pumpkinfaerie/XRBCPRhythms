	  	<h2>How To Join</h2>
  
  
<p><b>Whatever your previous drummng experience, we welcome new people joining us! The best ways to get started are:</b></p>
<p>Get the Telegram App for your phone, and join our "Newbie chat" group. Links for these are <a href="../index.html">on our main site</a>. The group is active, you can ask questions and usually we will reply fairly quickly.<br/><br/>

or<br/><br/>

Just turn up at a rehearsal and talk to us! See the Weekly Rehearsal Dates <a href="../calendar/index.html">on our calendar</a>. We often have spare instruments with us which you can pick up and play.<br/><br/>
</p>


<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><b>Where and when do you practice?<br/></b></p>

<p>Every week. We usually alternate between Thursday and Friday Evenings. Through the summer when the weather is good we practice outdoors on Maderia drive. See the Weekly Rehearsal Dates <a href="../calendar/index.html">on our calendar</a>.</p>

<p><b>Do I need musical experience?<br/></b></p>

<p>No, the songs are easy to learn, and you can learn by copying what other people are doing. It's fine to just turn up and work it out as you go along!

<p><b>Do I need my own instrument?<br/></b></p>

<p>No, not at first. We often have spares at our rehearsals that you can pick up and try. We also have some spare drums stored away which can be bought cheaply second hand. If you enjoy it and keep coming you will find that you probably want to get your own instrument.</p>

<p><b>How do you communicate and organize?</b></p>

<p>We use the messaging app Telegram to communicate with each other and discuss upcoming rehearsals and actions. If you want to get involved, the best way is to download the telegram app and join our "newbie channel", where you can chat to other new joiners and ask questions. Links for the app and our channels <a href="../index.html">on our main site</a>.</p>

<p><b>Will I be expected to attend actions and protests as well as rehearsals?<br/></b></p>

<p>The purpose of the band is to support actions and protests, however everyone is free to choose which events they feel comfortable attending or not. They can be intimidating for newbies, but there's no pressure for anyone to attend events. We hope as you become more confident that you will want to join us on the streets supporting Extinction Rebellion though! See our Events list on this board for upcoming events and videos of our past actions to get an idea of what it's like!</p>
